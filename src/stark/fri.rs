/// Generates a low degree proof for a set of a polynomial evaluations
///
/// I.e. generates a proof that the set of evaluations is associated, with high probability, to a polynomial of degree less than an input.
///
/// This function uses a [FRI](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2017/11/22/starks_part_2.html) like algorithm.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `original_values` - the list of evaluations of the polynomial for which we provide the proof, the evaluations must be ordered as the successive powers of the generator of the prime field,
/// * `original_commitments_tree` - the Merkle tree formed from the list of evaluations, the coherence with the original evaluations input is not checked in the function,
/// * `units` - the list of units, ordered as successive powers of the generator of the prime field,
/// * `max_degree` - the degree under which the polynomial must belong,
/// * `excluded_indices` - a list of unit indices that should not be selected during proof generation.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// For a more detailled version, please consult the README of the module.
///
/// Let us state two important remarks:
/// 1. this algorithm will only work with prime field containing a sufficiently large subgroup of order 2^k.
///    More concretely, for `N` the prime, we need prime field such that `N - 1` is divisible by the factor `4` as much as possible.
///    This is a required ingredient for the process of `space reduction` during the indirect proofs generation step.
/// 2. let us define `g` the generator of our prime field. The generator is used in order to derive the units as successive power of `g`.
///    I.e. `units = [g, g^2, g^3, ... , g^(N-1)]`.
///    The input evaluations are done over these "ordered" units.
///
/// The function starts by preparing for the recursive part:
/// - the number of indirect steps is pre-computed,
/// - the diagonal evaluations are instantiated as the original evaluations,
/// - the diagonal commitments are instantiated as the original commitments, the function does not check that these commitments match with the evaluations,
/// - the row dimension is instantiated as the number of units,
/// - the excluded indices along the row is instantiated with the provided list, if any,
/// - the original commitment root hash is saved for the output proof.
///
/// ## Indirect steps
///
/// At each step:
/// - the diagonal commitment root hash is used in order to pseudo randomly select the unit describing the column: `x_c`,
/// - the diagonal polymomial is evaluated as a binomial polynomial along the column `x = x_c`, for each unit in the column:
///     - the four diagonal evaluations on this row are selected using their indices: `column_unit_index + i * (N-1)/4, i = 0, 1, 2, 3`,
///     - the polynomial of the row is interpolated using Lagrange interpolation,
///     - the polynomial is evaluated at `x = x_c`,
/// - the column evaluations are committed,
/// - the excluded indices of the column are computed from the ones of the row: if a column index is on a row with an excluded index, it is excluded.
///   In practice, it means mapping `index -> index % (row_dimension / 4)`,
/// - the root of the column commit is used in order to pseudo randomly select indices of the rows that will be added to the proof for this step.
///   Indices must not be in the list of exluded ones. An additional index is taken in case we select the row crossing the diagonal at `x = x_c`, if this is the case, we remove this row and use the additional one instead,
/// - for each selected row, we select the four diagonal evaluations and their Merkle roots, we also select the associated column evaluation and its Merkle proof, these five commitments form the proof for the row of the indirect step,
/// - the next step is prepared:
///     - the row dimension becomes the column dimension, i.e. it is divided by 4,
///     - the diagonal evaluations and commitments are set to the column ones,
///     - the row excluded indices are set to the previously computed ones for the column
///
/// We end up with a list of indirect proof, each defined as a list of proof for a row, each defined as five proven evaluations:
/// - 4 coming from the diagonal evaluations,
/// - 1 coming from the column evaluation.
///
/// ## Final and direct step
///
/// - the final indices are pseudo randomly selected from the lastly defined diagonal commitments, these indices must not contain any lastly defined excluded indices,
/// - for each index, we select the evaluation with its Merkle proof.
///
/// ## Proof content
///
/// The proof is simply build as:
/// - the list of indirect proofs,
/// - the direct commitments,
/// - the root hash of the original commitments.
